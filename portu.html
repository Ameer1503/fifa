        <p><span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 700;text-align: center;">Team Overview</span><br><br>The best is yet to come... says Portuguese coach Fernando Santos. Combine his bullish words with the reality that this is likely to be Cristiano Ronaldo’s final World Cup and you have the perfect backdrop for what is expected for the Seleção going into Qatar.</p>
        <p>antos is a polarising character. On one hand he has overseen Portugal’s most successful period in their history. A Euro 2016 victory came as a surprise for many, as Portugal managed to grind their way through the tournament, drawing all 3 group games and only winning one knockout game in normal time on their way to European Supremacy. It was a very average side, despite having one of the greatest goal scorers of all time, who rode their luck at times but were incredibly difficult to break down.</p>
        <p>After an underwhelming 2018 World Cup, the future was still looking bright for Portugal. A new generation of talent began to sift through the national pool and this was reflected in their 2019 victory of the inaugural Nations League on home soil.</p>
        <p>Despite this, Santos has persisted in playing some of the elder statesmen of the side, creating a bottleneck of talent, waiting to break into the first team. This wasn’t more evident than Portugal’s exit to Belgium at the 2020 Euros, with players such as João Félix, Pedro Gonçalves and Nuno Mendes left to rot on the bench.</p>
        <p>Post-Euros, Portugal have been in good form. Wins against Turkyie and Switzerland at home were standouts but they have also struggled against elite opposition, especially when going a goal down. Some positives to note are the introduction of Mendes and Leao, as Santos has shown more of an open mind to the younger generation, but there is still much work to be done in this department and I fully expect Santos to play it safe at the beginning of the tournament.</p>

    <p><span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 700;text-align: left;">Team Tactical Outline</span><br><br>
        Portugal have exclusively used a 4-3-3/4-2-3-1, geared to playing in very fast transitions.<br> Santos prefers to keep it safe with his midfield selection but has favoured very attacking fullback to balance this out. <br> Portugal don’t have the tactical issues that we’ve outlined with other teams as their set up for the most part is sound. <br> It’s more of a question whether Santos is prepared to switch it up if Plan A fails and personnel selected.
