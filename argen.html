            The 2014 World Cup Final did not provide Messi with the legacy of ‘heroic failure’ that the likes of Puskas and Cruyff acquired on the back of their respective campaigns with Holland and Hungary in 1954 and 1974. Neither did that World Cup capture the nation's imagination quite like their memorable campaign in 2006 which ended in glorious failure yet elevated Riquelme to cult status.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is partly due to the fact that the football played by Argentina during that fateful summer did not rewrite the history books. Furthermore the spectre of Maradona weighed heavily on anything Messi attempts to achieve in an Albiceleste shirt. Messi’s reluctance that night to collect the runners up medal betrayed his acceptance that anything less than the gold medal around his neck would prove to be a heavy cross he would bear for the rest of his life.
        </p>
        <p>
            After a series of failed attempts to use the Copa America as a coping mechanism, 2021 proved to be a turning point. Argentina had been transitioning away from its 2010s "golden generation" in favour of a younger core, which was reflected in manager Lionel Scaloni's call-ups for La Albiceleste. The team remained led by captain Lionel Messi, along with veterans Ángel Di María and Sergio Agüero, as the last three remaining members of the 2014 World Cup team that finished as runners-up to Germany.

    <p><span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 700;text-align: left;">Team Tactical Outline</span><br><br>
        Scaloni has utilised a variety of formations during his reign in charge. <br> During 2021, 4-4-2 was the default formation, utilised 58% of the time - whereas in 2022, <br> the 4-3-3 seems to be the preferred formation. Having said that, during the Finalissimo, <br> a 4-2-3-1 was utilised (itself a variation of the 4-4-2 and 4-3-3). With Lo Celso's injury, <br> it is even harder to predict exactly what Scaloni will go with but what we do know is that a back 4 will be utilised, <br> Paredes and De Paul will form a double pivot of sorts, Di Maria will occupy a flank and Messi will roam behind Lauturo Martinez.
